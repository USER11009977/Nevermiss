## Description

Welcome to Roblox-Bot, the ultimate tool for enhancing your Roblox gaming experience! Our tool, Nevermiss, is a Roblox executor that offers a lifetime package and access to a HvH server. However, it is important to note that Nevermiss has a controversial reputation in the Roblox community due to its association with the previous software Santo-ware and concerns about the safety measures implemented by the owner. Despite its past, Nevermiss is here as a rebranded version of Santo-ware, now presented as an external tool for your gaming convenience.
